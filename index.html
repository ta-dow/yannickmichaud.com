                    <h2>Yannick Michaud</h2>
                    <p>
                        I am a French Canadian photographer based in a small town outside of Montreal, Quebec. Saying that I love photography would be an understatement as I adore every facet of this technical art. I have been shooting commercial product and portrait assignments for 25 years.
                        <br><br>
                        Photography certainly changed my life and has brought me on a great adventure. I met a beautiful Danish classmate in the darkrooms of Dawson College and we were married by the end of our final semester. Turns out love can also be developed in a darkroom!
                        <br><br>
                        We moved to Copenhagen, Denmark and I worked in some of Scandinavia’s top studios. There I learned the “Scandinavian’ look to lighting and image creation which has always fascinated me as a photographer. 
                        <br><br>
                        My client list was impressive as I quickly became known as a photographer with a speciality in the beauty care and cosmetic industry. I had Lancôme, L’Oreal and Givenchy as my main clients, and I did loads of assignments for magazines, brochures and major ad campaigns.
                        <br><br>
                        I returned to Canada in 2003 where a major camera company hired me to head the Technical department across North America. This gave me the opportunity to continue a new facet of my photographic adventure where I discovered life outside of a studio and learned to appreciate another genre of photography: wildlife.

                                Travelling throughout North America gave me a unique perspective to my photography and helped me break out of my comfort zone. Sometimes throwing yourself in a different genre of photography helps motivate you to learn new techniques and styles which you would never have imagined would be so exciting. Spending so much time in the Canadian Rockies changed my life and helped me in my photographic career as I travelled through some of the world’s most beautiful locations and photographed everything from great grey owls, grizzly bears and lynx, just to name a few of the amazing wildlife you can encounter if you are patient and a little lucky!

                                Throughout my travels across North America, I truly discovered the geographic diversity and vastness found in this continent. The mountains of Western Canada enthral me and captivate my imagination. The rugged landscape of Newfoundland on Canada’s east coast beguiles the imagination and the serenity of the American South West enchants the soul. Whether I am photographing a simple image or creating a massive Panoramic photograph, the most important thing Is to be patient and wait for the right lighting conditions to come my way.

                                Product photography is both fascinating and engaging. Creating a beautiful image of an everyday product is challenging and a rewarding undertaking. In the studio, you control the lighting and set the mood that will introduce the product to the public and help sell it. Getting it right is a team undertaking where communication and understanding of the client’s needs must be met.

                                    For me, portrait photography is what started it all and always holds a place dear in my heart. Getting to meet different people from different cultures, age groups and interests and capturing their essence in a single image is, for me, exciting and an amazing challenge. I prefer creating portraits in black & white and will use different tools in order to create the image that I wish. Sometimes I will use a digital camera and other times a 4x5 and medium format film camera fit best.
